## Simple cellular automata with multiple rulesets to choose

Third lua proyect, made to learn. Click a tile in the board to make it alive, to start the simulation press the spacebar

Keybinds:

```s
space: Starts/Stops the simulation

r: Randomizes the board

n: Displays the number of neighbours of each cell (goes one step behind)

h: Toggles the heatmap view. The more neighbours a cell has, the redder it appears

up arrow/down arrow: Changes the velocity of the simulation by 0.5 (steps per second)
```
